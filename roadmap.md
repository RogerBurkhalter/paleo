# Roadmap of Activities for the TDWG Paleo Interst Group
## Darwin Core
1. Review the categories and terms. For each category and term evaluate:
   1. If the category or term is applicable to paleobiology. Identify non-applicable terms.
   2. If applicable, does the term need further refinement for paleobiology implementation?
      1. Post issue regarding that term to foster discussion
      2. Submit recommendations for vocabularies and best practices in the implementation of the term for paleobiology use cases
   3. Propose any new terms that are not currently included in Darwin Core
2. Develop a document of paleobiological use cases
   1. Create an index of use cases with 1 sentence summaries
   2. For each use case provide a one page detailed summary
3. Based on the review of terms, create a Darwin Core extension, DwC-paleo
   1. Create a draft list of terms to be included in the extension
   2. Document the terms in the extension with examples, vocabularies and best pracices tailored to paleobioilogy
   3. For each use case provide an example specimen encoded in DwC-paleo
 
 
## ABCD EFG
1. Create an update mapping of categories and terms between DwC-paleo and ABCD EFG
