# Paleo Interest Group

## Rationale
The Paleo Interest Group exists to support the use of standards, such as Darwin Core and ABCD, for paleobiological data.  The group also seeks to broaden the adoption of data standards and data management best practices within paleobiology by improving documentation, providing examples. Paleobiological data span a broad range of taxonomic, geographic and temporal frames, and the Paleo Interest Group also seeks to network with similar efforts in related domains such as climatology, geochemistry, stratigraphy, and geochronology.
