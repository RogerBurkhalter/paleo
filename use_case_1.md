#Use Case 1 Single fossil mandible fragment, DIK-24-1#
##Abstract##
This use case documents the example of a single mammalian fossil mandiblular fragment (left mandible fragment with m1 crown) from the Dikika study area in NE Ethiopia. Details about the specimen are available in Geraads et al. 2011. Enhydriodon Dikikae sp. nov (Carnivora: Mammalia), A gigantic otter from the Pliocene of Dikika, Lower Awash, Ethiopia. Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology. 31(2):447-453.
##Comments##
The speciment is assigned to a new species but is not the holotype. This should be a fairly common fossil use case.

###Record-level Terms###
```dcterms:type: 'Physical Object'```   
or "http://purl.org/dc/dcmitype/PhysicalObject" See [issue #3](https://github.com/tdwg/paleo/issues/3)   
    
```dcterms:modified: "2017-03-07T18:37-0600"```    
String literal represent 7 March 2017 at 6:37 PM Central Time. Should ISO 8601 be best practice? See [Issue #5](https://github.com/tdwg/paleo/issues/5).   
    
```dcterms:language: "en"```  
Recommended Darwin Core best practice is controlled vocabulary such as RFC 4646.   
   
```dcterms:license: ??```   
What is recommended best practice for licensing in academic and/or commercial paleontology? See [issue #6](https://github.com/tdwg/paleo/issues/6)  
   
```dcterms:rightsHolder:'Authority for Research and Conservation of Cultural Heritage, Ethiopia'```  
[ARCCH](http://www.mysc.gov.et/ARCCH.html). Need a controlled vocabulary for institutions and rights holders in paleobiology.See [issue #7](https://github.com/tdwg/paleo/issues/7).  
    
```dcterms:accessRights: ??```   
Need documentation on how accessRights differs from dcterms:license, and some guidelines on best practices. See [issue #8](https://github.com/tdwg/paleo/issues/8).
